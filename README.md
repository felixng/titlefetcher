# titlefetcher
A simple one page app to grab titles of posts from a wordpress blog post link provided, by grabbing the h2 title

Need to add some more defensive codes

* if it's not a blog page
* if it's not a wordpress site
* if it's not a structured as h2 title
* if it has more h2 tags than the titles
